This is an alphabeta pruning Java tree used for adversary search in AI I wrote this in Java cause it seemed easier with classes

To create a tree, run the main function and it will give a menu for the root node of the tree and you can add stem nodes and leaf nodes along with traversing the tree that you've built. 

Here is an example of the menu

After you've finished constructing the tree, to get the final value, pick the "back" option when you're on the root node


To construct a tree like this,
